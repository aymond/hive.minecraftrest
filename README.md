# MinecraftREST

A powerful REST API interface for Minecraft servers that provides secure endpoints for server management and player interactions.

## Features

- üîí Secure JWT Authentication
- üöÄ RESTful API endpoints for server management
- üë• Player management (kick, gamemode, messaging)
- üìä Server information and statistics
- ‚ö° Rate limiting protection
- üîç Real-time player and world data

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Spigot/Paper server 1.20.4

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aymond/hive.minecraftrest/releases)
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins` folder
3. Start/restart your server
4. Configure the plugin in `plugins/MinecraftREST/config.yml`

## Configuration

The plugin creates a `config.yml` file in `plugins/MinecraftREST/` with the following options:

```yaml
# API Configuration
api-port: 4567  # The port on which the HTTP API will run

# Security Configuration
security:
  jwt-secret: "your-secret-key-here"  # Change this to a secure random string
  max-requests-per-minute: 60  # Rate limiting threshold
  admin-credentials:
    username: "admin"  # Change this to a secure username
    password: "change-this-password"  # Change this to a secure password
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Change the default security settings before using in production!

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login`
  - Request body: `{"username": "admin", "password": "your-password"}`
  - Response: `{"token": "jwt-token"}`

### Server Management

- `GET /api/server/info` - Get server information
- `POST /api/server/command` - Execute console command
- `POST /api/broadcast` - Broadcast message to all players

### Player Management

- `GET /api/players` - List online players
- `POST /api/player/message` - Send message to player
- `POST /api/player/kick` - Kick player
- `POST /api/player/gamemode` - Change player gamemode

All endpoints except `/api/auth/login` require JWT authentication via Bearer token.

## API Usage Example

```bash
# Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:4567/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your-password"}'

# Use token to get server info
curl http://localhost:4567/api/server/info \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token"
```
